Linear regression
The dataset taken from the source of data.gov.in website in the sector of science and technology .
**Dataset :** Rainfall in all India and its departure from normal for Monsoon session from 1901-2021. 
**Dataset description**This dataset contains 6 attributes and 121 instances. 
**problem statement :** Analysing the depature of rainfall in monsoon season.
**Loss Function:** The model uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function to minimize the squared differences between predicted and actual rainfall values
**Model :** In this model i use linear regression to analayse the departure of rainfall.The model's performance is evaluated on both training and test sets by calculating the MSE on predictions.
The model aims to minimize MSE on both sets and avoid overfitting.
**Evaluation:**
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values, indicating the average magnitude of errors.
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination): Measures how well the linear regression model explains the variance in the total monsoon rainfall. An R² value close to 1 indicates a good fit.
